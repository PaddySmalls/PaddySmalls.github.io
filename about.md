Hi, my name is Patrick. Currently, I'm a computer science grad student at Stuttgart Media University and also
work as an intern at Bertsch Innovation GmbH. <br/>
Over the past few years, I developed a strong focus on a bunch of topics:

- Backend development (especially in Java)
- Open Source
- Distributed Systems
- Linux and operating systems in general

Therefore, most of the content I'm producing will be heavily related to these subjects. 
If you like my posts or you want to bring upany questions, comments or constructive criticism, 
feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Apophis1990).   

Thanks for reading!
